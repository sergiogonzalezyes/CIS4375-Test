# CIS4375 Project

This project consists of two main components: the frontend and the backend. Below are the instructions to set up and run both servers.

---

## Frontend

The frontend is developed using [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/) and requires [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) and npm to be installed.

## Backend

The backend is developed using [Python](https://www.python.org/) and utilizes the [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.3.x/) Framework by pip install.

### Frontend Server (Vuejs)

1. Navigate to the frontend directory:
   ```bash
   cd Frontend
   
2. Run dependency install
    ```bash
    npm install
    
3. Run Server after dependency install
    ```bash
    npm run dev

### Backend Server (Flask)

1. Navigate to the backend directory:
   ```bash
   cd Backend
   
2. Run dependency install
    ```bash
